## [JSON parser](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser)

- My attempt at solving the challenge given in the above link
- It was good learning experience overall to be able to validate only the test json files
- I **might** add some more feature in it, but till then it is good enough

### NOTE FOR DEVELOPER: To test the package, write a json file in the `testdata` dir, and run the command `make test`
### If want to test the valid json file, the name must include `valid` init
- Preferably the format should be `valid.json`, `valid1.json` and so on
### If want to test the invalid json file, the name must include `invalid` init
- Preferably the format should be `invalid.json`, `invalid1.json` and so on
